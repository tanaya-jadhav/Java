Problemone.java and Problemtwo.java are solutions for the first two problems from ProjectEuler.net
Problemone.java: a simple main method that prints the sum of all numbers less than 1000 that are multiples of 3 or 5
Problemtwo.java: a simple main method that prints the sum of all even numbers in the fibonacci sequence upto 4,000,000.

Room.java: Creates a new class Room and allows you to:
  state the number of people in each instance of Room, 
  add or remove people from any specified room,
  get the number of people in a room,
  get the total number of people in the building
RoomTest.java: Tests the Room class by creating new Room objects and manipulating the number of people in each room.

ComplexNumber.java: Creates a Complex number class and allows you to:
  add complex numbers together
  subtract complex numbers
  multiple complex numbers
  divide complex numbers
  find the conjugate of a complex number
CNTest.java: Tests the complex number class by creating new complex numbers. Initiates 2 complex numbers "hey" and "bye".

TicTacToe.java: Simulates a game of Tic Tac Toe between two players. Takes the spot players want to mark as input of row first and column next.
                Allows players to restart the game. Stops running when players don't want to start a new game anymore.
                
ModuleTwo.java: A program that can take in data from a text file and tally the digits in the nth position of each number. 
                Useful in finding the 0th digit and seeing if the data follows Benford's Law
                Takes the digit n as input. Change name of data file in the program to run on a different file. 
                Example data file: Instagram_Data.txt
